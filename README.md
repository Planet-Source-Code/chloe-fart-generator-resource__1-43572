### Description

Since I work with a bunch of men who are all a bunch of jokers I thought I would make this for them. The ZIP posted here has two projects; A DLL project and EXE project. When you open the Group project it will open both and you can review the code and try it out. The DLL is a Fart Resource DLL that has one class with two exposed methods. PlayFart(you pick the far) and RandomFart. I used this DLL and remotely installed it on my coworkers machines into their MTS(COM+ Applications) and then posted a ASP page onto each of their web servers. This allowed me to go to their webserver and fire off the RandomFart :) It was great hearing farts coming from down the hall and others in the office area actually thinking the person in the room was doing it.  :) :) :) Of course now they are going to get me back. Anyhow, thought I would share it here to incase any of you want to try it out.
